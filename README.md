# RER::Web

![Screenshot](http://x0r.fr/blogstuff/rer-web.png)

This web app is yet another variation on the "how can I possibly display the
timetable for the 6 next trains in any way I can imagine" theme.  Only this
time, it tries to be classy.  It is primarily intended for display on medium
(tablet/desktop) or large screens (TVs), while trying not to break too badly on
cellphones.

See it in action at [http://monrer.fr/] [1].

I know the SNCF's website does the same thing, but let's face it, this
interface is sexier.  This project started an AJAX and Javascript exercise
for myself, but a handful of people have convinced me to make this public.

# Dependencies

You will need the following Perl modules:

 * DateTime
 * DateTime::Format::Strptime
 * DBI
 * DBD::mysql
 * Dancer
 * Dancer::Plugin::Redis
 * JSON::XS
 * RRD::Simple
 * Text::CSV
 * Template::Plugin::Decode
 * XML::Simple
 * YAML

You will also need `git` for the `install.sh` script to work.

Any kind of DBMS will do; however, you will need to load SNCF's rather massive
GTFS data into it and therefore, I recommend MySQL, PostgreSQL or anything
somewhat beefy.  I have tested this with MySQL without any problems.

# Installing

Copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and edit it to suit your needs.

Log into an account with administrative access on MySQL and create the database
holding the data:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE sncf_gtfs CHARSET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

Create a user which only has the necessary privileges.  This is optional, but
highly recommended (not to mention a good security practice):

	mysql> CREATE USER 'rer-web' IDENTIFIED BY 'some-password';
	mysql> GRANT SELECT, EXECUTE ON sncf_gtfs.* TO 'rer-web'@'localhost';

Finally, run `sh ./install.sh`. This install script will download a GTFS
parsing script, download the [GTFS-formatted timetable data] [5] from SNCF's
website, import it into the database, and import a custom-made station database
as well.

**Note**: SNCF update their data once a week. In order to reimport the data,
simply run `./install.sh` again.

# Deployment

Deploy this as you would any Perl Dancer application.  If you really
have no idea how to do this, read the [Dancer::Deployment Perldoc page] [2].
